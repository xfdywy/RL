1. What are the main challenges in reinforcement learning? We will cover the credit assignment problem and the exploration-exploitation dilemma here.

2. How to formalize reinforcement learning in mathematical terms? We will define Markov Decision Process and use it for reasoning about reinforcement learning.

3. How do we form long-term strategies? We define “discounted future reward”, that forms the main basis for the algorithms in the next sections.

4. How can we estimate or approximate the future reward? Simple table-based Q-learning algorithm is defined and explained here.

5. What if our state space is too big? Here we see how Q-table can be replaced with a (deep) neural network.

6. What do we need to make it actually work? Experience replay technique will be discussed here, that stabilizes the learning with neural networks.
