Hi all,

Here follows the open source codes I have tried:

https://github.com/kelvinxu/arctic-captions
This code does not include data preprocessing and trained models. I have a set of preprocessing working. However, I cannot achieve comparative results to those in the original paper. (and people on github are reporting similar results)

https://github.com/emansim/text2image
This works fine so far. Training costs only a little efforts, and the results matches their reported examples. (but no numerical measurements)

https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2
I am currently trying to get this to work. It seems that the code has some quirks, and the performance of pretrained model they posted is quite limited. Currently I am training my own one. I will update when results come out.

Regards,
